# Martin's Personal Website
**Disclaimer:** The redesigns on the website are NOT associated with any of the companies I've listed and are just projects I've done on my own time. 

## What is it? 
This is website created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript showcasing a personal portfolio of product redesigns I've done. I shared prototypes of the different apps and websites I worked on, as well as some aspects of my personal brand ("Sounds" page). 

I created about 95% of the components (HTML elements, prototypes, styling, images), and imported a library to assist with the animations. I used GitHub to host the website and keep track of changes to the website going forward. 

## Files

**index.html:** The home page of the website. I integrated the foundations here, including the fonts, animation libraries, and any bootstrap element I might need. Users can access all the pages of the site through this section. There are links to the Home (the dot), Projects and Sounds page all on the navigation bar above. Below are brief descriptions of the projects with links attached to their individual pages. At the footer, I embedded a link to my email on my name as well as links to my most used social networks. 

**sounds.html:** This was a page I created just to share a bit of my personal brand. It's a simple list of music playlists I created on Spotify. I designed it similarly to the home page in that the entire viewport is initially covered by a background image along with a few elements. In this case, it's the latest playlist I created with a description and an embedded link from Spotify. Similar to other music platforms, I attached images of the playlist along with the name so that it looked more personalized.

**yelp.html, thescore.html, elysian.html:** These pages showcase the redesigns I did for each product. I experimented with HTML elements such as containers, videos, and images to make sure that the pages were understandable on the web and mobile. Throughout the page, I explain my process throughout the design, incorporating images or video demos of the prototypes I created for visual aid. I also chose to animate these specific components to guide a user's eyes as they scroll down. 

**yelpproto.mp4:** A short video containing the demo for one of my prototypes. 

**styles.css:** This was the styling page which helped me show the website as I wanted it to look. In this file, I arranged the style formatting so that it would go from general to specific. On top are stylings for the general body of every page, and as you scroll down, you see more class-specific stylings for unique elements such as the navbar, footer, video demo, or containers. I used media queries as well to account for mobile viewers, and animated most components through this page.

## Design Choices

**Simplicity**: This was a priority to building the website. I ensured to design all components of the website in a way which served the singular purpose of _informing the user about my personal portfolio_. All elements are clearly separated, accessible, and distinguishable from one another. I applied the same thinking with the language to communicate my decisions in a precise, but understandable manner. 

**Mobile-Friendliness**: All pages on the site should be equally functional on a mobile device as it is on a laptop. I made sure that commonly misused element such as text and images scaled when seen on mobile (occupying a similar amount of space), and that no element was any less visible so that information flowed just as well.

**Personality**: I personally am a visual learner, so imagery is a major component of the website. I like to let images explain just as much as text, and you can see this throughout different pages. For the home page, I use a background image taken on a trip in Whistler, Canada alongside my bio to share a bit of my background. On the project pages, I made sure there was a fair balance between text and images in explaining my process to sustain engagement. Lastly, on the sounds page, I designed it to look as much like as a classic music platform by adding the playlist covers and Spotify player.
