# Martin's Personal Website
**Disclaimer:** Hi! This is my personal website where you can find some of my side projects, as well as some personal interests. The redesigns on the website are NOT associated
with any of the companies I've listed and are just projects I've done on my own time. 

Your README.md file should be minimally multiple paragraphs in length, and should explain what your project is, what each of the files you wrote for the project contains and does, and if you debated certain design choices, explaining why you made them. Ensure you allocate sufficient time and energy to writing a README.md that you are proud of and that documents your project thoroughly. Be proud of it!
