# Martin's Personal Website
**Disclaimer:** The redesigns on the website are NOT associated with any of the companies I've listed and are just projects I've done on my own time. 

## What is it? 
This is website created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript showcasing a personal portfolio of product redesigns I've done. I shared prototypes of the different apps and websites I worked on, as well as some aspects of my personal brand ("Sounds" page). 

I created about 95% of the components (HTML elements, prototypes, styling, images), and imported a library to assist with the animations. I used GitHub to host the website and keep track of changes to the website going forward. 

## Files

**index.html:** The home page of the website. I integrated the foundations here, including the fonts, animation libraries, and any bootstrap element I might need. Users can access all the pages of the site through this section. There are links to the Home (the dot), Projects and Sounds page all on the navigation bar above. Below are brief descriptions of the projects with links attached to their individual pages. At the footer, I embedded a link to my email on my name as well as links to my most used social networks. 

**sounds.html:** This was a page I created just to share a bit of my personal brand. It's a simple list of music playlists I created on Spotify. I designed it similarly to the home page in that the entire viewport is initially covered by a background image along with a few elements. In this case, it's the latest playlist I created with a description and an embedded link from Spotify. Similar to other music platforms, I attached images of the playlist along with the name so that it looked more personalized.
