# Martin's Personal Website
Hi! This is my personal website where you can find some of my side projects, as well as some personal interests. The redesigns on the website are NOT associated
with any of the companies I've listed and are just projects I've done on my own time. 

I'm curious to learn more about using Python, HTML/CSS/Javascript, and Figma as a means to build digital experiences. Feel free to reach out!
